					<h1>Unit A:  Energy and Matter in Chemical Change (Nature of Science Emphasis)</h1>
					<strong>Overview:</strong> Chemical changes involve energy and transformations of matter.  A knowledge of the underlying structure of matter and the basic chemical species is important in understanding chemical changes.  As students explore the properties of molecular and ionic compounds, including acids and bases, they begin to appreciate the need for a classification scheme and a system of nomenclature. Students classify, name compounds and write balanced chemical equations to represent chemical changes.  As well, students are introduced to the law of conservation of mass and the mole concept.

 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Reactions That Form Solids </h3>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Showing States in Chemical Formulas </h3>
<i>Elements </i>  
   <ul>
	<li>Metals are solid, except for mercury, which is a liquid </li>
	<li>Most of the diatomic elements are gases: H<sub>2</sub> (g),N<sub>2</sub> (g), O<sub>2</sub> (g), F<sub>2</sub> (g), and Cl<sub>2</sub> (g).  </li>
	<li>Bromine is a liquid and iodine is a solid:  Br<sub>2</sub> (l) and I<sub>2</sub> (s). </li>
	<li>Sulfur, phosphorus, and carbon are solids </li>
   </ul>
 <br>
<i>Compounds </i>
   <ul>
	<li>All ionic compounds are solid at room temperature. </li>
	<li>An ionic compound that is very soluble is shown as aqueous when it is dissolved in water.  An ionic compound that is slightly soluble is usually shown as a solid, even when it’s in water.</li>
 	<li>Molecular compounds are very difficult to predict.  The smaller the molecules are, the more they tend to be gases.  The larger they are, the more they tend to be liquids and then solids. </li>
   </ul>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Energy Changes </h3>
<i>Exothermic Reactions </i>  <br>
<span class="def">Exothermic reaction </span> – a chemical reaction that releases energy, usually in the form of heat, light, or electricity
 <br>
<span class="def">Combustion </span>– exothermic chemical reaction that occurs when oxygen reacts quickly with a substance to form a new substance or substances; burning <br>
 <br>
<i>Endothermic Reactions </i> <br>
<span class="def">Endothermic reaction </span>– a chemical reaction that is energy absorbing <br>
<span class="ex">Ex. </span> <span class="example">barium hydroxide octahydrate + ammonium thiocyanate + energy &rarr; barium thiocyanate + ammonia + water </span><br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Biochemical Reactions </h3>
<span class="def">Photosynthesis </span>– how plants convert sunlight to chemical energy <br>
<span class="def">ie. </span> <span class="example">energy + carbon dioxide + water &rarr; glucose + oxygen </span><br>
<span class="def">CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + H<sub>2</sub>O (l) &rarr; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (aq) + 6 O<sub>2</sub> (g)</span> <br>

 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Characteristics of Chemical Reactions </h3>
All reactions involve the production of new substances with their own characteristic properties, including:  state at room temperature, melting point, colour, and density <br>
All reactions involve the flow of energy, detected as a change in temperature during the reaction  <br> 
 <br>
When new substances form in chemical reactions sometimes changes of state can be observed:  bubbles indicate a gas, precipitates indicate a solid <br>
 <br>
All chemical reactions are consistent with the law of conservation of mass  <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Conservation of Mass </h3>
<span class="def">Law of conservation of mass </span> – total mass of the reactants in a chemical reaction equals the total mass of the products <br>
 <br>
Atoms cannot be created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction, they are simply rearranged into different molecules and sometimes different states.  <br>
 <br>
<span class="ex">Ex. </span>
	<span class="example">  When wood burns, the glucose in the wood reacts with the oxygen in air and produces carbon dioxide and water vapor, which are released into the air.  If you were to take a large air tight container and burn the wood, the mass of the air and wood, before burning would be the same as the mass of the ashes, and smoke, after burning. </span><br>

A chemical equation is very similar to a mathematical equation.  The number of each type of atom must be the same on the left and right side of the arrow.  It also includes the state of each compound.  <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Symbolizing Chemical Change </h3>
To write a chemical equation you require the following: <br>
<ul>
	<li>Careful observation </li>
	<li>Knowledge of what substances are present at the start of the reaction </li>
	<li>The ability to analyze the materials produced by the reaction </li>
</ul>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Writing Word Equations </h3>
The reactants placed on the left side, and the products are placed on the right side of the arrow.  A plus sign is placed between the names. <br>
 <br>
<h3 class="S10Ac">Writing Balanced Formula Equations </h3>
<span class="def">Formula equation </span>– chemical equation that uses the chemical formulas of reactants and products in a chemical reaction <br>
<span class="def">Skeleton equation </span>– formula equation showing the identity of each substance involved in a chemical reaction; does not show the correct proportions of the reactants and the products <br>
Keep the most complicated compound on the reactant side at one and balance all of the compounds
 <br>
Balance the number of elemental molecules. <br>
<span class="ex">Ex. </span> What is the balanced equation for the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen that forms water? <br>

<span class="def">Molar mass </span>– mass of one mole of a substance <br>

<span class="def">Atomic molar mass </span>– average molar mass of an element’s atoms, including those of all the element’s different isotopes.
 
Chemists had to choose an element to be the standard for the conversion from atomic mass unit to grams.  Since, carbon-12 is relatively easy to make 100% pure it was chosen.  Carbon 12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons so it has an atomic mass of 12 units.  A mole of carbon 12 atoms has a mass of 12 grams. <br>
 <br>
The masses on the periodic table are weighted average mass for a mole of material.  They are not exact, carbon is 12.01 because there are different forms of carbon, isotopes, so they took average samples. <br>
