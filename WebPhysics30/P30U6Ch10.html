		<strong>Review</strong> <br>

		All matter is composed of microscopic atoms. <br>
		Electric charges are carried in the atom by electrons and protons. <br>
		Protons have a  positive charge (1+). <br>
		Electrons have a negative charge (1-). <br>
		Neutrons have neutral (zero) charge (0). <br>

		  <br>		
		Like charges repel  <br>

		  <br>
		<strong>The Law of Conservation of Charge </strong> <br>
		The net charge of an isolated system is conserved. <br>
		Charges cannot be created nor destroyed.  They can only be transferred from one object to another. <br>
		  <br>
		<strong>Charging by Friction </strong> <br>
		Some atoms have a stronger hold on their electrons than others. <br>
		When two objects rub the one with the stronger hold on their electrons will strip electrons from the other object. <br>

		<strong>Problem:   </strong> <br>
		What is the relationship between force, charge and distance? <br>
		<strong>Background information: </strong> <br>
		Opposite charges attract, like charges repel.  The more charge an object has the more force that acts on it.  As the distance increases the force decreases. <br>
		<strong>Manipulated variable </strong> <br>
		1<sup>st</sup> graph Distance and 2<sup>nd</sup> graph charge <br>
		<strong>Responding variable: </strong> <br>
		Force <br>
		<strong>Control variables: </strong> <br>
		<ul>
		  <li>Preventing air currents from affecting results by doing the experiment in a closed container.</li>
		  <li>Preventing outside charges from affecting the results by doing the experiment in a closed glass (insulator) container.</li>
			<li>Preventing gravity from affecting results, by arranging the forces sideways. </li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Procedure: </strong> <br>
		<ol>
			<li>Set up torsion balance to measure small forces. </li>
			<li>Charge each end of the torsion balance and the test sphere. </li>
			<li>Move the torsion arm to a specified distance. </li>
			<li>Measure the acceleration of the torsion balance and calculate the force. </li>
			<li>Repeat for different charges and distances. </li>
		</ol>
