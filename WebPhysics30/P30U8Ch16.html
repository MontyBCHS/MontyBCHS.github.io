			<span class="def">Isotope </span>– an atom with a different number of neutrons than normal.  <br>

			It can be lighter or heavier.  The mass given on the periodic table is a weighted average of all the different isotopes based on their frequency. <br>

			In1905 Albert Einstein showed that mass and energy are equivalent. <br>
			The mass defect (change) is measured in atomic mass units. <br>
			1 u = 1.66&times;10<sup>-27</sup> kg <br>
			
			By comparing the mass of the nucleus to the mass of the nucleons, physicist found that the mass of the nucleus was lower than expected.  <br>

			The nucleus is very stable because it has lost mass as energy.  It requires large amounts of energy to cause a reaction within the nucleus and break the nucleons apart. <br>

			The more binding energy (lost mass) the nucleus has, the more stable the nucleus is (in nuclear reaction terms). <br>

          <h2 class="P30bg secTitle">16.2  Radioactive Decay </h2>
			Antoine Henri Becquerel discovered that compounds of uranium radiate a form of energy and cause photographic plates to react. <br>
			Marie and Pierre Curie studied this radiate energy and called it radiation.  The amount of radiation was dependent only on the mass of the uranium.  Therefore it had to be caused by the nucleus of the atom. <br>
			It is not affected by temperature. <br>
			Marie coined the term radioactive. <br>
			
			There are three forms of nuclear radiation: <br>
			<ul>
				<li>Alpha &alpha; <br>
					<ul>
						<li>the emission of a helium nucleus </li>
						<li>stopped by approx. 10 cm air </li>
						<li>stopped by paper </li>
						<li>not dangerous unless ingested, then it is extremely dangerous </li>
						<li>Used to poison Russian spy in England (Aleksander Litvinenko, 2006)</li>
						IMAGE
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Beta particle  &beta;  <br>		
					<ul>
						<li>emission of a high energy electron </li>
						<li>stopped by few m of air </li>
						<li>stopped by Al foil </li>
						<li>penetrates outer layers of skin </li>
						<li>medium danger </li>
						IMAGE
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Gamma ray &gamma; <br>
					<ul>
						<li>emission of high frequency EMR </li>
						<li>stopped by several cm of lead shielding </li>
						<li>passes through humans </li>
						<li>extremely dangerous, avoid at all costs !!! </li>

			<strong>Conservation Laws and Radioactive Decay </strong> <br>
			<span class="def">Charge </span>– the electrical charge is conserved.  <br>
			<span class="ex">eg. </span> Beta decay <br>
			When a neutron (0 charge) decays, it breaks into a proton (positive) and an electron (negative). <br>

			<strong>Conservation Laws and Radioactive Decay </strong> <br>
			<span class="def">Atomic mass number </span>– the atomic mass number before and after is the same.  The binding energy mass is very small compare to the atomic mass number. <br>	
	
			<span class="ex">eg. </span> The atomic mass of the daughter nuclei are the same as the parent nucleus. <br>

			<strong>Alpha decay </strong> <br>
			Nucleus loses two protons and two neutrons <br>

			IMAGE <br>

			<strong>Beta Decay </strong> <br>
			<span class="def">Beta negative </span>- a neutron breaks into a proton and a high speed electron and antineutrino. <br>
			IMAGE <br>
			<span class="def">Beta positive </span>- a proton breaks into a neutron and an anti-electron, a positively charged electron called a positron, and a neutrino. <br>
			IMAGE <br>

			<strong>Gamma decay</strong> <br>
			Emission of a very high frequency EMR <br>
			An unstable nucleus emits its excess energy in the form of gamma EMR to become a stable nucleus. <br>
   			 	IMAGE <br>

			
			Atoms radioactively decay to become stable (dotted line).  The larger the nucleus the less likely the atom is stable.  <br>
			Above 84 nucleons all are radioactive. <br>

			<strong>Potential Hazards of Nuclear Radiation </strong> <br>
			<span class="def">Radiation Sickness </span>– radiation can ionize cellular material (cause an electrical charge).  This disrupts the body’s biochemistry, and can kill vital organ cells.  Can be minor or fatal depending on the dose of radiation. <br>
			<span class="def">Genetic Damage </span>– High energy particles and gamma rays can alter DNA and cause mutation (cancer).  These can show up 10 to 15 years later. <br>
