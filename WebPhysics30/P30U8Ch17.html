          <h2 class="P30bg secTitle">17.2 Quantum Theory and The Discovery of New Particles </h2>	
		In 1928 Paul Dirac combined Einstein’s theory of relativity and Schrodinger’s wave equations of the atom and predicted the existence of antimatter.  Antimatter is matter with an opposite charge (electron that is positive, positron) <br>

		In 1932 Carl Anderson photographed the first proof of antimatter.  It was a particle with the charge to mass ratio of an electron but curved the opposite direction in a magnetic field. <br>

		Antimatter is the same as regular matter except that it has the opposite electric charge. <br>

		Matter plus antimatter changes mass into energy. <br>

		<strong>Quantum Field Theory </strong> <br>
	
		Forces:  electrostatics, gravity, weak nuclear and strong nuclear force are created by the exchange of mediating particles (virtual).  These virtual particles travel back and forth between the involved actual particles. <br>

		Subatomic particles (smaller than proton and neutron) are groups of particles found only in particle accelerators and are being researched to determine how they interact. <br>

		They are described by their mass as energy per speed of light squared. <br>
