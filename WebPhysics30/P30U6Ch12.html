		<strong>Cause of magnetism </strong> <br>
		In 1820 Danish professor Hans Christian Oersted noticed that the needle of a nearby compass deflected each time the circuit was switched on. <br>

		Right hand rule (RHR) thumb points in the direction of the current flow and the fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field. <br>
		
		Use the left hand for the field caused by moving negative charges. <br>

		Right hand positive, left hand negative <br>

		Oersted showed that magnetism and electric currents are connected.  Moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. <br>
		
		<span class="def">Electromagnet </span>– uses a current carrying coil (solenoid) to generate a magnetic field that is easy to switch on and off. <br>
		The strength of the magnetic field is increased by: <br>
		<ul>
			<li>Increasing the current through the wire. </li>
			<li>Increasing the number of loops in the coil. </li>
			<li>Decreasing the size of the loops in the coil. </li>
			<li>Changing the core of the coil. </li>
		</ul>

		<strong>RHR 2 for solenoids (coil) </strong>
		The fingers point in the direction of the conventional current and the thumb shows the magnetic north of the coil. <br>
		Use the left hand for electron flow. <br>
		
		<strong>Domain theory </strong> <br>

		In ferromagnetic materials adjacent atoms align to reinforce each other.  Each region of aligned atoms is called a domain.  If the domains align within the material it becomes magnetic. <br>

		<!-- Force magnetic on current carrying wire ********************************************* -->
		<br>
		The wire experiences a force because the magnetic field of the moving electrons in the wire interacts with the external magnetic field around the wire. <br>
		
		Micheal Faraday (UK) and Joseph Henry (USA) discovered that a wire in a changing magnetic field has an induced potential difference across it.  <br>
		This is the generator effect. <br>
	
		When a wire moves through a magnetic field, a voltage is induced in the wire. <br>
		When a loop of wire moves through a magnetic field, a voltage is induced in the wire, which causes a current to flow. <br>
		
		In a generator a loop of wire (armature) is mechanically spun which creates a current flow.  The commutator transfers the current from the armature to the external circuit. <br>
		
		In an electric motor, the current flows through the armature which creates a magnetic field that interacts with the motor’s magnetic field to cause the motor to rotate. <br>
