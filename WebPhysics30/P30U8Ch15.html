	 <h2 class="P30bg secTitle">15.1  The Discovery of the Electron </h2>
			In the 5th century BC, Democritus used the word atom (from atomos meaning undivisible, uncuttable) to describe the smallest particles of matter. <br> 
			This was shown by heating compounds and breaking them into their component elements.   <br>
			In 1803 John Dalton developed an atomic theory to explain why elements combined in specific ratios to form compounds.  This work led to the modern periodic table of the elements.  However, it did not explain what was inside the atom. <br>
			Dalton’s model of the atom (Democritus).  Solid and indivisible. <br>
			In 1897 Joseph John Thomson discovered that cathode rays are negatively charged particles.  These particles were later called electrons. <br>
			J.J. Thompson proposed that atoms were made of a solid positive with electrons embedded in it to balance the electrical charge.  (raison bun or plum pudding) <br>

			In 1909 Millikan announced that he had measured the charge of the electron. <br>
	
			By calculating the minimum increase in the electric charge Millikan was able to determine the charge of an electron to be e= -1.60&times;10<sup>-19</sup> C. <br>

			Combined with Thompson’s charge to mass ratios, Millikan’s value also led to the mass of the electron, proton and alpha particle. <br>

		<h2 class="P30bg secTitle">15.3  The Discovery of the Nucleus </h2>
			
			1909 Ernest Rutherford was working with alpha particles and fired a beam of alpha particles at an extremely thin gold foil (few atoms thick).  <br>

			His hypothesis:
			<ul>
				<li>the electrons would have very little effect on the alpha particles due to the alpha particle’s relative mass.  </li>
				<li>the positive part of the gold would cause one or two degrees of scattering because the mass was so spread out throughout the gold foil.</li>
			</ul>

			The experiment showed his hypothesis was incorrect. <br>
			The alpha particles scattered a large amount, some even traveled straight back from the foil. <br>

			He said “It is like shooting a cannonball at tissue paper and having the cannonball rebound at you.” <br>
			Conclusions: <br>
			<ul>
				<li>The alpha particles bounced off of something, therefore what they hit had to be very heavy and dense.</li>
				<li>The alpha particles were defected in all directions which would only happen if they passed by a positively charged object.</li>
				<li>The size of the center was extremely small compared to the size of the atom.</li>

		<h2 class="P30bg secTitle">15.4  The Bohr Model of the Atom </h2>
			If the electrons in the Rutherford model are moving in a circle than they are constantly accelerating.  <br>
			According to Maxwell’s equations an accelerating electron would radiate EMR, lose energy and spiral into the nucleus. <br>
			Bohr used spectroscopy to make a new model of the atom explaining the electrons movement. <br>
			A heated low pressure gas emits very specific frequencies of visible light EMR.  <br>
			Each elements exhibits a unique pattern of EMR when heated, or when light is shone through. <br>
			An electron can move from one energy level to another only by either emitting or absorbing energy equal to the difference between the two energy levels.  An electron that stays in a particular orbit does not radiate any energy.  <br>
			Since the size and shape of the orbit remain constant along with the energy of the electron, the orbits are often called stationary orbits. <br>

			Due to the wave nature of atoms, the only stable orbitals are ones in which the circumference of the orbit is equal to a whole number multiple of the electron’s wavelength. <br>

			As a result it is impossible to measure the exact radius of orbit.  Orbits are expressed as a zone of statistical probability. <br>
