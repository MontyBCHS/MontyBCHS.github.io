            A point of intersection of the lines on a graph <br>

            A pair of values occurring in the tables of values of both equations <br>
            <br>
            Systems of linear equations can be modelled numerically, graphically or algebraically. <br>
            The solution to a linear system is a pair of values that occurs in each table of values, an intersection point of the lines on a graph, or an ordered pair that satisfies each equation. <br>
            One way to solve a system of linear equations is to graph the lines and identify the point of intersection on the graph. <br>
            <br>
            A solution to a system of linear equations can be verified using several methods: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Substitute the value of each variable and evaluate the equations.
                <li>Create a graph and identify the point of intersection.
                <li>Create tables of value and identify the pair of values that occurs in each table.

            When modelling word problems, assign variables that are meaningful to the context of the problem. <br>
            To assist in visualizing or organizing a word problem, you can use a diagram and /or a table of values. <br>
            <br>
    
            If a situation involves quantities that change at constant rates, you can represent it using a system of linear equations. <br>
            <br>
            If you know the initial values and rates, you can write the equations directly in slope-intercept form because the intial value is the y-intercept and the rate is the slope.  Otherwise, you can determine the rate of change using start and end values. <br>

            When solving a system of linear equations, there are three possible options for the results: 
            <ol>
                <li>Intersect at one point (most common) </li>
                <li>Intersect at an infinite number of points (coincident lines) </li>
                <li>No intersection (no solution, parallel lines) </li>

            <div class="definition">
                <h3>Coincident lines </h3>
                <p>Lines that occupy the same position <br>
                In a graph of two coincident lines, any point of either line lies on the other line. </p>
            </div>  <!-- end definition -->
    
            A system of linear equations can have one solution, no solution or an infinite number of solutions.
            Before solving, you can predict the number of solutions for a linear system by comparing the slopes and y-intercepts.
    
            For some linear systems, reducing the equations to lowest terms and comparing the coefficients of the x-terms, y-terms, and constants may help you predict the number of solutions.
