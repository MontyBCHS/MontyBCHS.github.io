                        <p> While students have sketched the graphs of linear relations in previous grades, this outcome is their introduction to the concept of slope.</p>
                        <p> In Achievement Indicators 3.2 and 3.3, students are expected to draw conclusions, through investigation, about lines with a:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> positive or negative slope</li>
                            <li> slope of zero</li>
                            <li> slope that is undefined.</li>
        
                        </ul>
                        <p> In Achievement Indicator 3.8, students are expected to develop, through investigation, the rules for determining whether two lines are parallel or perpendicular.  </p>
                        <p> Slope can be referred to as a rate of change, specifically the rate of change of the variable y with respect to the change in the variable x. If slope is discussed in context, the units for each variable should be included with the slope; e.g., if the context provides a relationship between distance in meters and time in seconds, then the rate of change of distance with respect to time should be expressed in m/s and related to the slope of the graph. </p>
                        <p> The focus of this outcome is to develop a visual understanding of slope and then, when solving problems, to connect slope to the concept of rate of change.   </p>

                          <p> When writing a linear equation in general form, e.g., Ax+ By+ C= 0, the coefficients A, B and C must be integers and, by convention, A> 0.

                                <p> Students are expected to determine the equation of a linear relation algebraically. </p>
                                <p> Technology [T] has not been identified as one of the mathematical processes to be emphasized in completing this outcome. There may be some opportunities for students to use technology to investigate the equations of linear relations, given two or more points on the graph, but students are expected to meet this outcome without the use of technology. </p>
                                <p> Linear regression is not part of this outcome. </p>
                                <p> In Achievement Indicators 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, students are expected to apply and explain multiple strategies to write the equation of a linear relation in each situation; e.g., given the slope and a point, students could substitute the coordinates of the point and the slope:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> directly into the slope </li>
                                    <li> point form to determine the equation of the linear relation </li>
                                    <li> into the slope </li>
                                    <li> intercept form of the equation to determine the y-intercept. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p> In Achievement Indicators 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, students are expected to explain the reasoning used in determining their equations.   </p>
                                <p> In Achievement Indicators 7.5 and 7.6, students are expected to identify any restrictions on the domain and range of the linear relation. </p>
