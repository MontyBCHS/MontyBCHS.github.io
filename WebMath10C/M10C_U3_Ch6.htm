                        <h3>General Notes</h3>
                        <p> It is important that teachers view the nine specific outcomes in this topic as a package and not as individual outcomes. Teachers may choose to develop lessons and activities that include parts of several outcomes.</p>
                        <p> Prior knowledge from previous grade levels includes: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> an introduction to linear relations, including tables of values and graphs (Grade 7) </li>
                            <li> graphing and analyzing two-variable linear relations (Grade 8) </li>
                            <li> using linear relations to solve problems, including graphing,  interpolation and extrapolation (Grade 9). </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Technology [T] has been identified as one of the mathematical processes to be emphasized in completing this outcome. It is expected, however, that students will be able to graph both linear and nonlinear data with and without the use of technology.  </p>
                        <p> Students are expected to draw graphs that include a title, properly label led axes and appropriate scales. </p>
                        <p> For a given context, students are expected to identify key points on a graph, such as intercepts or points where the graph changes direction.  </p>
                        <p> While students may have previously discussed restrictions on the variables in a linear relation, this is the first time that the terms domain and range are addressed. Some ways students may describe the domain and range for a linear relation include: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> written or verbal descriptions </li>
                            <li> lists </li>
                            <li> set builder notation; e.g. ,{ <span class="equation">x |–2<span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size:larger">&nbsp; &ge;&nbsp;</span> x < 3, x <span style="white-space: nowrap; font-size:larger">&isin; &nbsp;</span>R</span> } </p></li>
                            <li> interval notation; e.g., (–2, 3). </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> It is essential that students understand and are able to use set builder notation and interval notation effectively since these will be the primary ways of describing sets of numbers in future courses including Mathematics 20-1 and 20-2. </p>
                        <p> Students are expected to distinguish between continuous and discrete data and understand their implications for a graph. </p>

                <h3>Slope </h3>
                <p>The ratio of the vertical change, or rise (Y axis), to the horizontal change, or run (X axis) of a line or line segment. <br>
                Slope can have units, Y axis per X axis.</p>
            </div>  <!-- end definition -->
            
            The slope of a line is the ratio of the rise to the run. <br>
            slope = rise / run <br>
    
            The slope of a line can be determined using two points on a line, (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>). <br>
    
            If you know one point on the line you can use the slope to find other points on the line. <br>
            The slope is the average rate of change. <br>
