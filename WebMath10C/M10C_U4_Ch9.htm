            Substitution method <br>
            An algebraic method of solving a system of equations <br>
            Solve one equation for one variable, substitute that value into the other equation, and solve for the other variable. <br>
    
            <br>
            You can solve systems of linear equations algebraically using substitution. <br>
            Isolate a single variable in one of the two equations. <br>
            Where possible, choose a variable with a coefficient of 1. (1x or x or 1y or y) <br>
            <br>
            Substitute the solution of the first variable into on of the original equations.  Solve for the remaining variable. <br>
            Check your answer by substituting into both original equations. <br>

            Elimination method <br>
            An algebraic method of solving a system of equations. <br>
            Add or subtract the equations to eliminate one variable and solve for the other variable. <br>
            <br>
            A table can help you organize information in a problem.  This can help you to determine the equations in a linear system. <br>
            You can solve a linear system by elimination <br>
            <br>
            If necessary, rearrange the equations so that like variables appear in the same position in both equations.  The most common form is ax + by = c. <br>
            Determine which variable to eliminate.  If necessary, multiply one or both equations by a constant to eliminate the variable by addition or subtraction.<br>
            Solve for the second variable by substituting the value for the first variable into one of the original equations. <br>
            Check your solution by substituting each value into both original equations. <br>

            It may be better to use an algebraic approach to solve linear equations when <br>
