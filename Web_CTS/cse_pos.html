<p class="hangingindent"><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <a href="#CSE2010">CSE2010: Computer Science 2</a> ; <a href="#CSE1240">CSE2110: Procedural Programming 1 </a> </p>
<p class="hangingindent"><strong>Description: </strong>Students explore hardware, software and associated processes at an advanced level.  They extend their understanding of software development by moving from procedural programming approaches to an object-oriented approach.  In the process they learn how object-oriented programming (OOP) can improve the efficiency and robustness of algorithm development and program construction.
