<h2><center>PROGRAM RATIONALE AND PHILOSOPHY </center> </h2>                                                                            
Students graduating from Alberta schools require the scientific and related technological knowledge and skills that will enable them to understand and interpret their world and become productive members of society. They also need to develop attitudes that will motivate them to use their knowledge and skills in a responsible manner. Science programs provide opportunities for students to develop knowledge, skills and attitudes that they need to explore interests and prepare for further education and careers. <br>
 <br>
To become scientifically literate, students must develop a thorough knowledge of science and its relationship to technologies and society. They must also develop the broad-based skills needed to identify and analyze problems; explore and test solutions; and seek, interpret and evaluate information. To ensure that programs are relevant to students as well as societal needs, a science program must present science in meaningful context—providing opportunities for students to explore the process of science, its applications and implications, and to examine related technological problems and issues. By doing so, students become aware of the role of science in responding to social and cultural change and in meeting needs for a sustainable environment, economy and society. <br>
 <br>
<b>Program Vision </b>  <br>
The secondary science program is guided by the vision that all students have the opportunity to develop scientific literacy. The goal of scientific literacy is to develop the science-related knowledge, skills and attitudes that students need to solve problems and make decisions, and at the same time help them become lifelong learners— maintaining their sense of wonder about the world around them. <br>
 <br>
Diverse learning experiences within the science program provide students with opportunities to explore, analyze and appreciate the interrelationships among science, technology, society and the environment, and to develop understandings that will affect their personal lives, their careers and their futures. <br>
 <br>
<b>Goals </b>  <br>
The following goals for Canadian science education are addressed through the Alberta science program. Science education will:
<ul>
	<li>encourage students at all grade levels to develop a critical sense of wonder and curiosity about scientific and technological endeavours </li>
	<li>enable students to use science and technology to acquire new knowledge and solve problems, so that they may improve the quality of their own lives and the lives of others </li>
	<li>prepare students to critically address science related societal, economic, ethical and environmental issues </li>
	<li>provide students with a foundation in science that creates opportunities for them to pursue progressively higher levels of study, prepares them for science-related occupations, and engages them in science-related hobbies appropriate to their interests and abilities </li>
	<li>enable students, of varying aptitudes and interests, to develop a knowledge of the wide spectrum of careers related to science, technology and the environment. </li>
</ul>
 <br>
<b>PROGRAM FOUNDATIONS </b>  <br>
To support the development of science literacy, school programs must provide a foundation of learning experiences that address critical aspects of science and its application. These critical areas—the foundations of the program—provide general direction for the program and identify major components of its structure. <br>
 <br>
<img src="POS-Fig-1-Rationale-and-Philosophy.png" width="550" height="400" alt="Program Rationale and Philosophy"/> <br>
<b>Foundation 1 </b> <br>
Science, Technology and Society (STS)—Students will develop an understanding of the nature of science and technology, the relationships between science and technology, and the social and environmental contexts of science and technology. <br>
 <br>
<b>Foundation 2 </b> <br>
Knowledge—Students will construct knowledge and understandings of concepts in life science, physical science and Earth and space science, and apply these understandings to interpret, integrate and extend their knowledge. <br>
 <br>
<b>Foundation 3 </b> <br>
Skills—Students will develop the skills required for scientific and technological inquiry, for solving problems, for communicating scientific ideas and results, for working collaboratively and for making informed decisions. <br>
 <br>
<b>Foundation 4 </b> <br>
Attitudes—Students will be encouraged to develop attitudes that support the responsible acquisition and application of scientific and technological knowledge to the mutual benefit of self, society and the environment. <br>
 <br>
<h2><center>Foundation 1: Science, Technology and Society (STS) </center> </h2>
Foundation 1 is concerned with understanding the scope and character of science, its connections to technology, and the social context in which it is developed. The following is a brief introduction to the major ideas that underlie this component of the program. <br>
 <br>
<b>Nature of Science </b> <br>
Science provides an ordered way of learning about the nature of things, based on observation and evidence. Through science, we explore our environment, gather knowledge and develop ideas that help us interpret and explain what we see. Scientific activity provides a conceptual and theoretical base that is used in predicting, interpreting and explaining natural and technological phenomena. Science is driven by a combination of specific knowledge, theory and experimentation. Science-based ideas are continually being tested, modified and improved as new knowledge and explanations supersede existing knowledge and explanations. <br>
 <br>
<b>Science and Technology </b> <br>
Technology is concerned with solving practical problems that arise from human needs. Historically, the development of technology has been strongly linked to the development of science, with each making contributions to the other. While there are important relationships and interdependencies, there are also important differences. Where the focus of science is on the development and verification of knowledge, in technology the focus is on the development of solutions, involving devices and systems that meet a given need within the constraints of the problem. The test of science knowledge is that it helps us explain, interpret and predict; the test of technology is that it works—it enables us to achieve a given purpose. <br>
 <br>

 <br>Social and Environmental Contexts of Science and Technology
The history of science shows that scientific development takes place within a social context. Many examples can be used to show that cultural and intellectual traditions have influenced the focus and methodologies of science, and that science in turn has influenced the wider world of ideas.
Today, research is often driven by societal and environmental needs and issues. As technological solutions have emerged from previous research, many of the new technologies have given rise to complex social and environmental issues. Increasingly, these issues are becoming part of the political agenda. The potential of science to inform and empower decision making by individuals, communities and society is a central role of scientific literacy in a democratic society. <br>
 <br>
<h2><center>Foundation 2: Knowledge </center> </h2>
Foundation 2 focuses on the subject matter of science, including the theories, models, concepts and principles that are essential to an understanding of each science area. For organizational purposes, this foundation is framed using widely accepted science disciplines. <br>
 <br>
<b>Life Science </b> <br>
Life science deals with the growth and interactions of life forms within their environments in ways that reflect their uniqueness, diversity, genetic continuity and changing nature. Life science includes such fields of study as ecosystems, biological diversity, the study of organisms, the study of the cell, biochemistry, genetic engineering and biotechnology. <br>
 <br>
<b>Physical Science </b> <br>
Physical science, which encompasses chemistry and physics, deals with matter, energy and forces. Matter has structure, and there are interactions among its components. Energy links matter to gravitational, electromagnetic and nuclear forces in the universe. The conservation laws of mass and energy, and of momentum and charge, are addressed in physical science. <br>
 <br>
<b>Earth and Space Science </b> <br>
Earth and space science brings global and universal perspectives to student knowledge. Earth, our home planet, exhibits form, structure and patterns of change, as does our surrounding solar system and the physical universe beyond it. Earth and space science includes such fields of study as geology, meteorology and astronomy. <br>
 <br>
<h2><center>Foundation 3: Skills </center> </h2>
Foundation 3 is concerned with the skills that students develop in answering questions, solving problems and making decisions. While these skills are not unique to science, they play an important role in the development of scientific understandings and in the application of science and technology to new situations. Four broad skill areas are outlined in this program of studies. <br>
 <br>
<b>Initiating and Planning </b> <br>
These are the skills of questioning, identifying problems and developing preliminary ideas and plans. <br>
 <br>
<b>Performing and Recording </b> <br>
These are the skills of carrying out a plan of action that involves gathering evidence by observation and, in most cases, manipulating materials and equipment. <br>
 <br>
<b>Analyzing and Interpreting </b> <br>
These are the skills of examining information and evidence; processing and presenting data so that it can be interpreted; and interpreting, evaluating and applying the results. <br>
 <br>
<b>Communication and Teamwork </b> <br>
In science, as in other areas, communication skills are essential at every stage where ideas are being developed, tested, interpreted, debated and agreed upon. Teamwork skills are also important, as the development and application of science ideas is a collaborative process both in society and in the classroom. <br>
 <br>
<h2><center>Foundation 4: Attitudes </center> </h2>
Foundation 4 is concerned with generalized aspects of behaviour—commonly referred to as attitudes. Attitude outcomes are of a different form than outcomes for skills and knowledge; they are exhibited in a different way, and they have deeper roots in the experiences that students bring to school. Attitude development is a lifelong process that involves the home, the school, the community and society at large. <br>
Attitudes are best shown not by the events of a particular moment but by the pattern of behaviours over time. Development of positive attitudes plays an important role in students' growth by interacting with their intellectual development and creating a readiness for responsible application of what is learned. <br>
 <br>
<b>Interest in Science </b> <br>
Students will be encouraged to develop enthusiasm and continuing interest in the study of science. <br>
 <br>
<b>Mutual Respect </b> <br>
Students will be encouraged to appreciate that scientific understanding evolves from the interaction of ideas involving people with different views and backgrounds. <br>
 <br>
<b>Scientific Inquiry </b> <br>
Students will be encouraged to develop attitudes that support active inquiry, problem solving and decision making. <br>
 <br>
<b>Collaboration </b> <br>
Students will be encouraged to develop attitudes that support collaborative activity. <br>
 <br>
<b>Stewardship </b> <br>
Students will be encouraged to develop responsibility in the application of science and technology in relation to society and the natural environment. <br>
 <br>
<b>Safety </b> <br>
Students will be encouraged to demonstrate a concern for safety in science and technology contexts. <br>
 <br>

 <div style="color:green;">
    <h2><center>Unit A: Applications of Matter and Chemical Change (Science and Technology Emphasis)</center> </h2>
     <br>
    <b>Overview: </b> <br>
    In Science 14, Unit A: Investigating Properties of Matter, students investigated the classification of elements and the properties of mixtures and solutions encountered at home or in the workplace. Students will extend their understanding of matter, by investigating and classifying simple chemical reactions used at home and in the workplace. Students also become aware that many different materials can be created from a relatively small number of components and that technologies based on chemical changes are widely used in producing useful materials for our daily use. <br>
     <br>
    <b>Focusing Questions:  </b>
    <ul>
        <li>What are some of the chemical reactions that are important in today's society and in meeting our personal needs? </li>

    <b>Overview: </b> <br>
     In Science 14, Unit B: Understanding Energy Transfer Technologies, students learned that energy conversions occur all around us. In this unit, students investigate a variety of important energy conversions occurring in biological, chemical, physical and technological systems.

    <b>Overview:  </b> <br>
    There is a greater risk of being injured or killed while travelling in a car or other motor vehicle than in other common activities.

    <i>(e.g., draw a force–time graph for cushioned and noncushioned toy cars, in an investigation of the effectiveness of different types of cushions for a toy car) </i>
    <li>identify a line of best fit on a scatterplot, and interpolate or extrapolate based on the line of best fit </li>
    <i>(e.g., graph distance–time relationships) </i>
    <li>interpret patterns and trends in data, and infer or calculate linear or nonlinear relationships among variables </li>
    <i>(e.g., determine speed [velocity] from a distance–time graph, or distance from a speed [velocity]–time graph) </i>
    <li>identify and apply criteria; i.e., social factors, explanations, methods, data, related research and relevance, including the presence of bias, for evaluating evidence and sources of information </li>
    <i>(e.g., identify and analyze a variety of factors that affect the authenticity of information derived from the mass media and electronic communication) </i>
    <li>identify and explain sources of error and uncertainty in measurement, and express results in a form that acknowledges the degree of uncertainty </li>
    <i>(e.g., list sources of uncertainty in the measurement of "reaction time," use SI units and unit analysis to check the results of mathematical solutions) </i>
        <li>explain how data support or refute the hypothesis or prediction </li>
    <i>(e.g., investigate the statements: "More traffic accidents occur on Monday mornings."; "More pedestrians than drivers are killed by cars.") </i>
        <li>identify new questions or problems that arise from what was learned </li>
        <i>(e.g., "What is whiplash, and why is it more common in rear-end collisions?") </i>
    </ul>
    <b>Communication and Teamwork </b> <br>
    Students will: <br>
    Work collaboratively on problems; and use appropriate language and formats to communicate ideas, procedures and results
    <ul>
    <li>communicate questions, ideas and intentions; and receive, interpret, understand, support and respond to the ideas of others </li>
    <i>(e.g., develop a plan to assess the safety features of new cars) </i>
    <li>select and use appropriate numeric, symbolic, graphical and linguistic modes of representation to communicate ideas, plans and results </li>
    <i>(e.g., create data tables and a summary of questionnaire results; graph results, using appropriate scales) </i>
    <li>evaluate individual or group processes used in planning, problem solving, decision making and completing a task </li>
    <i>(e.g., assess group processes used to evaluate cars for their safety features) </i>
    </ul>
    <h3>Attitude Outcomes </h3> 
    <b>Interest in Science </b> <br>
    Students will be encouraged to: <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Show interest in science-related questions and issues, and confidently pursue personal interests and career possibilities within science-related fields </li>
        <i>(e.g., explore and use a variety of methods and resources to increase their own knowledge and skills related to safety and driving; investigate careers in traffic law enforcement) </i>
    </ul>
    
    <b>Mutual Respect </b> <br>
    Students will be encouraged to:
    <ul>
    <li>Appreciate that scientific understanding evolves from the interaction of ideas involving people with different views and backgrounds </li>
    <i>(e.g., appreciate the benefits that have resulted from a better understanding of the law of conservation of momentum) </i>
    </ul>
    <b>Scientific Inquiry </b> <br>
    Students will be encouraged to:
    <ul>
    <li>Seek and apply evidence when evaluating alternative approaches to investigations, problems and issues. </li>
        <i>(e.g., develop explanations and descriptions about safety issues in transportation)  </i>
    </ul>
    <b>Collaboration </b> <br>
    Students will be encouraged to:
    <ul>
        <li>Work collaboratively in planning and carrying out investigations, as well as in generating and evaluating ideas  </li>
        <i>(e.g., help motivate others; listen to the points of view of others)  </i>
    </ul>
    <b>Stewardship </b>
    Students will be encouraged to:
    <ul>
    <li>Demonstrate sensitivity and responsibility in pursuing a balance between the needs of humans and a sustainable environment </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Safety </b> <br>
    Students will be encouraged to:
    <ul>
    <li>Show concern for safety in planning, carrying out and reviewing activities </li>
    <i>(e.g., follow safety regulations for drivers; respect others' space, materials and work during an activity) </i>
    </ul>
